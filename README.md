## Collaboration Guide
We have two main branches in the git repository:
- master: for stable version of code
- develop: for development version of code

You need to fork this repository and create a new branch for your own work(for example, `qyh`). After several commits on your own branch, you can checkout to `develop` branch and merge/rebase from your own branch. Then, you can make a pull request from your `develop` branch to the `develop` branch of the original repository. This procedure is trying to make a clearer git commit history.

Note: if you would like to get the latest development version of code, please checkout to `develop` branch.
