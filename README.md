## Collaboration Guide
We have two main branches in the git repository:
- master: for stable version of code
- develop: for development version of code

You need to fork this repository to your own account. Clone this repository in Eclipse. Create a new feature branch (for example, `qyh`) for your own development. After several commits on your own branch, you can checkout to your local `dev` branch and merge/rebase from your own branch. Then, fetch the latest remote branches `master` & `dev` from upstream (you can find it in Eclipse, maybe need configuration, you can follow [Github团队项目合作流程](https://www.cnblogs.com/schaepher/p/4933873.html#fetch)). Then, you can push the local `dev` branch to your fork repo and make a pull request from your `dev` branch to the `dev` branch of the original repository. This procedure is trying to make a clearer git commit history.

Note: 
- if you would like to get the latest development version of code, please checkout to `dev` branch.
- before you push
